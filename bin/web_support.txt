SUPPORT DATA HELP FILE

It is possible to get the su1x tool to send data to a web server.
The data will be sent using GET variables, and needs an appropriate script to read them then do somthign with them.

PHP was used at SWANSEA.

This file describes the variable names sent, so appropriate scripts can be written to manage support.

ALL DATA is sent via HTTPS. A valid cert is needed for this to work.
It may be wise to block requestes to these scripts from outside your wifi network ranges to stop potential abuse.

In the config.ini the following must be set:
show_support = 1
send_ldap = 1
send_problem = 1
